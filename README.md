 Inland Empire Solar Sales Travel
 Authors: Montana Rocha

 Project Description
The Inland Empire Solar Sales Travel project is a C++ program designed to help a solar marketing specialist find the shortest and most cost-effective route to market solar packages to homeowners in
Riverside, Moreno Valley (Moval), Perris, and Hemet.
The program calculates and displays the distance matrix, allowing users to choose between the shortest path, the most low-cost trip, or explore alternate routes to optimize their sales travel.

Programming Approaches
- The program uses C++ to model the cities and their connections in the Inland Empire
- It uses permutations to generate all possible travel routes.
- The program calculates and compares distances to find the shortest and most low-cost journeys between cities in the Inland Empire.
- The code is organized into classes for clarity and reusability.
- Asks for user input in order to generate matrix and all travel routes including extras.
